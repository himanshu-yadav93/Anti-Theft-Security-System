# Anti-Theft-Security-System
 This project presents a simple, anti-theft security alarm using basic electronic components. It's an excellent starter project for anyone interested in electronics, demonstrating the principles of infrared (IR) light detection and basic circuit logic. The core of the system is an IR photodiode and an IR LED.
